1. A boy runs 200 metres in 24 seconds. What is his speed ?
Explanation : 200/24 * 18/5 = 30 km/hr      -----> 18/5 used to convert minutes into hours and 5/18 convert hours into minutes

2.If the speed of a man is 45 km per hour, then what is the distance traveled by him in 30 seconds ?
Explanation :The distance traveled in 30 sec = 45*(5/18) *30 =375m

3.An escalator moves towards the top level at the rate of 11 ft.sec and its length is 140 feet. 
If a person walks on the moving escalator at the rate of 3 feet per second towards the top level, how much time
does he take to cover the entire length.
Explanation : Time taken to cover the entire length = total.distance/resultant speed = 140/(11+3) = 10sec

4.Two trains, 250 metres and 150 metres long respectively, are running on parallel lines.If they are
  running in the same directions, the faster train crosses the slower train in 40 seconds.If they are
  moving in the opposite direction they pass each other in eight seconds. What is the speed of the slower
  train?
Answer:  Note

5.With out any halt a train  travels a certain distance with an average speed of 75 km ph , and with halts
  it covers the same distance at an average speed of 60 kmph. When it is traveling with halts, how many
  minutes/per hour does the train halt on an average ?
Explanation:it take 60/75 = 4/5 = 48 minutes. 12 minutes is the halting time per hour

6.A lady starts from P towards Q and realizes that at a point R, if he walks 50 km further he will be at a
  point S, which is as far away from R as it is from Q. What is the distance between P and Q if the distance
  between P and R is half the distance from R to Q?( Assume that P, Q, R and S are all on the same
  straight line)
Explanation:Expl :    P_____50_____ R ______50_______S______50_____Q 

7.In a 1000 m race Usha beats Shiny by 5 m/s. In the same race, by what time margin Shiny beat Mercy
  who runs at 4 m/s?
Explanation:Time taken by shiny to complete the race is B = 1000/5 = 200 sec.
            Time taken by Baley to complete the race is D = 1000/4 = 250 sec
            Hence, D-B = 50 sec

8.A and B participate in a 5000 m bicycle race which is being  run on a circular track of 500 m. If the speed
   of A and B are 20 m/s and 10 m/s respectively, what is the distance covered by A when he passes B for
   the seventh time ?
Explanation:Track length = 500 m
Speed of A and B are 20m/s and 10 m/s respectively
Time taken by them to meet = length/ relative speed = 500/(20-10) 50 sec.
Time taken to meet for the 7th time = 7 *50 =350 sec ……..(1)
Total duration of race = total legth of race/ speed
                                    = 500/20 = 250 sec.……..(2)
From (1) and (2) we can find out that 7th time meeting is not possible.
